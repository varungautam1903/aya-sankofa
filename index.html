						<p><span>S</span> he live in a multicultural society that enables us to be in contact with a
							variety of cultures enriching our lives perspectives. However, the benefits can also
							initiate
							challenges. <br />
							Coming from a Caribbean heritage and as a first-generation French born, who is now
							living in Britain, sometimes I find myself saying that I am from nowhere and everywhere
							at the same time. Juggling between different cultures and multiple languages can lead
							to difficulties in understanding our identity and finding a sense of belonging. My unique
							firsthand perspective allows me to understand various aspects of diversity and
							appreciate what the real experience of belonging to several dimensions of diversity can
							be like. <br />
							My area of interest is intergenerational trauma, within families or communities, in which
							effects of trauma are passed down between generations. Counselling then, offers
							support to understand what drives their behaviors and negative cycles. As Dr. Gabor
							Maté says:</p>
						<p><i>“Trauma is the invisible force that shapes our lives. It shapes the way we live, the way
								we love and the way we make sense of the world. It is the root of our deepest wounds.”

				Within my practice, I use 3 major traditions as a therapist; Gestalt, Psychodynamic and

					<h4>Gestalt therapy</h4>
					<p>Gestalt helps you gain a better understanding of how your
						emotional and physical needs are connected. You will learn the awareness of
						how the present moment leads to an understanding of behaviors and feelings.
						Overall, it helps you to be more confident and aware of yourself. </p>

					<p> Psychodynamic helps you understand how your
						past, and in particular how your childhood, influences your current way of
						being. It also helps us to analyse the defence mechanism you are using to
						avoid painful feelings and experiences.</p>

					<div>
						<h4>Acceptance and Inclusivity</h4>
						<p>“Society has a tendency to issue labels that sometimes can lead to rejection and
							inadequacy. Therefore, it is very important at Aya Sankofa to provide all clients a space
							full of acceptance, where they can be their True self. ”</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h4>Patience and Diligence</h4>
						<p>“Some experiences of life can be difficult to talk about, and sometimes an individual can
							feel pressured to speak quickly (too quickly sometimes). Aya Sankofa aims to be patient
							and let you unravel your story at your own pace by carefully and persistently working
							with you.”</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h4>Personal narrative</h4>
						<p>“So many times, in life, people add their personal lived experiences into our own stories.
							Hence why, with Aya Sankofa, when working with clients the intent is to have them tell
							their stories, see the world through their eyes and a glimpse into their lives. <br />
							The individual growth and development of our clients is paramount, therefore, if our
							clients goals no longer align with our way of practicing, you will be recommended or
							referred to other service to better serve your needs.”</p>

					What are the benefits of online therapy?
				</h2>

				<div>
					<h4>Accessibility</h4>
					<p>Compared to traditional face-to-face counselling, online therapy is significantly more
						accessible. For people who face disease, or disabilities, it can be a lifeline. It's also a
						great backup plan in case something unforeseen occurs.</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<h4>Flexibility</h4>
					<p>You can take part in online therapy from almost anywhere. All you need is a confidential
						space and access to the Internet.</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<h4>Confidentiality</h4>
					<p>Given that mental health is receiving a lot more attention, some people are still
						ashamed to ask for support. The thought of being seen entering a counsellor office or of
						others finding out that you are receiving counselling can be eliminated with online
						therapy.</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<h4>There is no commute</h4>
					<p>Since you don't have to travel far to see your counsellor, you can save lots of time and
						money. You won't have to worry about parking, traffic, or public transports schedules,
						which will make you more at ease and able to participate in therapy.</p>
