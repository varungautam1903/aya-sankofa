  "aboutMe": "About me",
  "aboutMeDesc": "<span>W</span>e live in a multicultural society that enables us to be in contact with a variety of cultures enriching our lives perspectives. However, the benefits can also initiate challenges. <br> Coming from a Caribbean heritage and as a first-generation French born, who is now living in Britain, sometimes I find myself saying that I am from nowhere and everywhere at the same time. Juggling between different cultures and multiple languages can lead to difficulties in understanding our identity and finding a sense of belonging. My unique firsthand perspective allows me to understand various aspects of diversity and appreciate what the real experience of belonging to several dimensions of diversity can be like. <br> My area of interest is intergenerational trauma, within families or communities, in which effects of trauma are passed down between generations. Counselling then, offers support to understand what drives their behaviors and negative cycles. As Dr. Gabor Maté says:",
